# Project-Euler-Solutions

A collection of my solutions to Project Euler puzzles!

I'm trying to solve these in sequence, mainly as a way for me to stay familiar with the languages and tools i'm using.

As of 26/01/2023 I am working in C, C++, Haskell, and Python. I have aims to solve a roughly equal amount of programs in the different languages (apart from python) and expand the variety of languages I am using once I feel more comfortable with some of C++'s features.

I am applying a vague pattern of prime number based problems to be solved with C (and keep a personal prime library in use!) Problems that involve strings to be solved with C++ (To get a better handle on the abstractions) and any problems which have an already existent mathmatics analouge to be solved with haskell (see project 9).
Additionally, this is a good oppertunity to become familiar with git. I am still unsure on proper practice for uploading and commenting on changes but trying to improve.

#TODO

*Restructure programs into seperate project files. Do this in the 10-15 projects complete mark.

*Restructure project files into sub-folders of 10 or so.

*Define strict import modules to be used from within the various program folders, but shared by each.

*Get to level 2

*Read a good book on C++, and one on git and proper use.

*Adopt a new language (scala? clojure?) Read [this book](https://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/) for inspiration.
